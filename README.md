# Minicache

My goal with this small side project is to understand the inner workings of a cache storage, that stores some arbitrary data. In particular I want to understand, how to build a simple cache; and how storing data therein compares to storing it in a database on disk.

I plan to write it in Python to get a little more comfortable with the language.
